# Exploring the CISSP Security Domains

## Security Posture
- **Definition**: An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

## Security and Risk Management
- **Focus**: Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

### Key Concepts:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of risks like breaches.
- **Compliance**: Developing internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.
- **Business Continuity**: Maintaining everyday productivity by establishing disaster recovery plans.

## Asset Security
- **Focus**: Securing digital and physical assets, including storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

### Key Concept:
- **Handling PII and SPII**: Ensuring policies and procedures are in place to securely handle and protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII).

## Security Architecture and Engineering
- **Focus**: Optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

### Key Concept:
- **Shared Responsibility**: All individuals within an organization actively participate in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. Policies should encourage users to report security concerns.

## Communication and Network Security
- **Focus**: Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

### Key Concept:
- **Removing Unsafe Access**: Teams can remove access to unsafe communication channels or networks at the organizational level, discouraging employees from engaging in insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.

## Identity and Access Management
- **Focus**: Managing access and authorization to keep data secure by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage assets.

### Key Concept:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit employees' access to only what they need, reducing the overall risk to systems and data.

### Main Components:
1. **Identification**: User verification.
2. **Authentication**: Proof of identity with a password or PIN.
3. **Authorization**: Level of access.
4. **Accountability**: Monitoring and recording user actions.

## Security Assessment and Testing
- **Focus**: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

### Key Concept:
- **Effectiveness of Controls**: Examining organizational goals and objectives, and evaluating if the controls in place actually achieve those goals.

## Security Operations
- **Focus**: Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

### Key Concept:
- **Incident Response**: Mitigating active attacks and preventing escalation is critical. Upon neutralization, physical and digital evidence is collected to start a forensic investigation.

## Software Development Security
- **Focus**: Using secure coding practices.

### Key Concept:
- **Security in SDLC**: Security is an additional step in each phase of the software development lifecycle.
