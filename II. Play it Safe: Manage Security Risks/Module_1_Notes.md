# Exploring the CISSP Security Domains

## Security Posture
- **Definition**: An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

## Security and Risk Management
- **Focus**: Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

### Key Concepts:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of risks like breaches.
- **Compliance**: Developing internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.
- **Business Continuity**: Maintaining everyday productivity by establishing disaster recovery plans.

## Asset Security
- **Focus**: Securing digital and physical assets, including storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

### Key Concept:
- **Handling PII and SPII**: Ensuring policies and procedures are in place to securely handle and protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII).

## Security Architecture and Engineering
- **Focus**: Optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

### Key Concept:
- **Shared Responsibility**: All individuals within an organization actively participate in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. Policies should encourage users to report security concerns.

## Communication and Network Security
- **Focus**: Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

### Key Concept:
- **Removing Unsafe Access**: Teams can remove access to unsafe communication channels or networks at the organizational level, discouraging employees from engaging in insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.

## Identity and Access Management
- Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users  follow established policies to control and manage assets.

Limit employee's access to only what they need and reduce the overall risk to systems and data.
4 Main components:
1. Identification: user verfication
2. Authentication: proof ID with pass or pin
3. Authorization: level of access
4. Accountability: monitoring and recording user actions

## Security Assessment and testing
- Focused on conducting security control  testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

This domain involves examining organizational goals and objectives, and evaluating if the controls being used actually achieve those goals.


## Security Operations
- Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures

Mitigating active attacks and preventing escalation is critical. Upon neutralization, physical and digital evidence begins to start a forensic investigation.

## Software Development Security
- Focused on using secure coding practices

Security is an additional step in each phase of the software development lifecycle.
