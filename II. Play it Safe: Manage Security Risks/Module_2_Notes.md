# Frameworks

## Security Frameworks
- **Definition**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. These support organizations' ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.

# Controls

## Security Controls
- **Definition**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. These are measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.

### Common Types of Security Controls
1. **Encryption**: The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying who someone or something is.
3. **Biometrics**: Unique physical characteristics used to verify someone's identity.
4. **Authorization**: Granting access to specific resources in a system.

### Example Attack
- **Vishing**: Aims to exploit voices by impersonating a known source.

# The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

## Specific Examples

### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
- Provides a common language to communicate information about threat activity.
- Helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.

### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
- Enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
- Outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organizationâ€™s ability to manage risks.

## Types of Controls

### Physical Controls
- Gates, fences, locks
- Security guards
- CCTVs, cameras, motion detectors
- Access cards/badges

### Technical Controls
- Firewalls
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Antivirus software

### Administrative Controls
- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is a model for how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It consists of three core components:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity**: Ensures information is authentic, accurate, and reliable.
- **Availability**: Ensures information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.

Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture.
