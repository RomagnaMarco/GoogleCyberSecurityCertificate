# Frameworks

## Security Frameworks
- **Definition**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. These support organizations' ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.

# Controls

## Security Controls
- **Definition**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. These are measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.

### Common Types of Security Controls
1. **Encryption**: The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying who someone or something is.
3. **Biometrics**: Unique physical characteristics used to verify someone's identity.
4. **Authorization**: Granting access to specific resources in a system.

### Example Attack
- **Vishing**: Aims to exploit voices by impersonating a known source.

# The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

Specific Examples:

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
- provides a common language to communicate information about threat activity.
- helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently

International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
- enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
- outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organizationâ€™s ability to manage risks.

Physical Controls:
- Gates, Fences, locks
- security guards
- CCTVs, cameras, motion detectors
- access cards/badges
Technical Controls:
- Firewalls
- MFA
- antivirus software
Admin Controls:
- speration of duties
- authorization
- asset clalssification
