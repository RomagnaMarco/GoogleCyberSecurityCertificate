# Frameworks

## Security Frameworks
- **Definition**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. These support organizations' ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.

# Controls

## Security Controls
- **Definition**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. These are measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.

### Common Types of Security Controls
1. **Encryption**: The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying who someone or something is.
3. **Biometrics**: Unique physical characteristics used to verify someone's identity.
4. **Authorization**: Granting access to specific resources in a system.

### Example Attack
- **Vishing**: Aims to exploit voices by impersonating a known source.

# The Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

## Specific Examples

### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
- Provides a common language to communicate information about threat activity.
- Helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.

### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
- Enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties.
- Outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organizationâ€™s ability to manage risks.

## Types of Controls

### Physical Controls
- Gates, fences, locks
- Security guards
- CCTVs, cameras, motion detectors
- Access cards/badges

### Technical Controls
- Firewalls
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Antivirus software

### Administrative Controls
- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification

# Explore the CIA Triad // Using the CIA Triad to Protect Organizations

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is a model for how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It consists of three core components:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity**: Ensures information is authentic, accurate, and reliable.
- **Availability**: Ensures information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.

Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture.

# NIST Frameworks

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

### CSF 5 Core Functions:
1. **Identify**: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets
2. **Protect**: Strategy implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools for mitigating cybersecurity threats
3. **Detect**: Identifying potential incidents, improving monitoring capabilities to increase speed and efficiency of detections
4. **Respond**: Making sure proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process
5. **Recover**: The process of returning affected systems back to normal operation

## NIST Special Publication 800-53 (NIST S.P. 800-53)
NIST S.P. 800-53 is a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government.

# OWASP Security Principles

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimize Attack Surface Area
- **Definition**: Reduce all potential vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers.
- **Strategies**:
  - Disable unnecessary software features.
  - Restrict access to certain assets.
  - Implement more complex passwords.

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- **Definition**: Grant the least amount of access required to fulfill daily tasks.
- **Benefit**: Reduces the damage a breach could cause.

### 3. Defense in Depth
- **Definition**: Implement multiple controls addressing risks and threats in different ways.
- **Examples**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), firewalls.

### 4. Separation of Duties
- **Definition**: Ensure no one person is given too many privileges.
- **Example**: Different people to sign and prepare a paycheck.

### 5. Keep Security Simple
- **Definition**: Remove complex solutions to keep security manageable and collaboration possible.

### 6. Fix Security Issues Correctly
- **Definition**: Find the root cause and correct all vulnerabilities with tests.

### 7. Establish Secure Defaults
- **Definition**: The optimal security state of an application is its default state for users.

### 8. Fail Securely
- **Definition**: When a control fails or stops, it should default to its most secure option.

### 9. Don't Trust Services
- **Definition**: Third-party services have different security policies that may be insecure.

### 10. Avoid Security by Obscurity
- **Definition**: Key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden, but instead should rely on multiple factors for security.

# Plan a Security Audit

## Security Audit
A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations. While there are external and internal audits, we will focus on internal audits, which are more relevant to entry-level positions.

### Internal Audit
- **Definition**: Typically conducted by a team, including a compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members.
- **Purpose**: Helps security teams identify organizational risks, assess controls, and correct compliance issues.

### Common Elements of Internal Audits
1. **Establishing the Scope and Goals**
2. **Conducting a Risk Assessment**
3. **Completing a Controls Assessment**
4. **Assessing Compliance**
5. **Communicating Results**

### Scope and Goals
- **Scope**: The specific criteria of an internal security audit.
- **Goals**: Outline the organization's security objectives.

**Entry-level roles** would likely be required to understand the scope and goals in order to complete elements of the audit, while higher-ups would establish the scope and goals.

### Risk Assessment
- **Definition**: Identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- **Purpose**: Helps consider what security measures should be implemented and monitored to keep assets safe.

# Complete a Security Audit

Audit questions:
- What is the audit mean't to achieve
- Which assets are most at risk
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets
- What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented

Control categories
- Administrative: Human component, involve policies and procedures.
- Technical: hardware and software systems
- Physical: measures put in place to prevent physical access

Stakeholder communication
- summarize scope and goals
- Lists existing risks
- notes how quickly thtose risks need to be addressed
- identifies compliance regulations
- provides recommendations
