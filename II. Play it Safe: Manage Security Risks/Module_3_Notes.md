# Logs and SIEM Tools

**Log:** A record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks.

## Common Log Sources:
- **Firewall logs:** A record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet and outbound requests from the network to the internet.
- **Network logs:** A record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. Records connections between devices and services on the network.
- **Server logs:** A record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

**SIEM Tools:** Used to analyze log data to monitor critical activities.

 # SIEM Dashboards

**SIEM tools** can be used to create dashboards. These dashboards help security analysts quickly access their security information as charts, graphs, or tables. 

Dashboards enable analysts to identify outliers and unusual behavior more easily.

**Metrics:** Key technical attributes, such as response time, availability, and failure rate, are used to assess the performance of a software application.

# The future of SIEM tools

Currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for analysis of events

The need for cloud funcctionality has increased:
- SIEM tools  continue to evolve to function in cloud-hosted and cloud-native environments
- Cloud hosted tools are simply accessed through the internet and help organizations that don't want tto invest in cerating and maintaing their own infrastructure.
- Cloud native tools are also accessed through the internet, but designed to take advantage of cloud computing capabiltities ( availability, flexibility, scalability)
  
  Internet of things (IoT): The current development of interconnected devices with access to the internet
  - more devices mean larger attack surface and amount of exploitable data

AI anad ML progressing mean SIEM capabilities will be enhanced.

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR): a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events.
