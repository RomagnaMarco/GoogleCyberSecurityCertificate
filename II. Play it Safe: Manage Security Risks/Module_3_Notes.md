# Logs and SIEM Tools

**Log:** A record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks.

## Common Log Sources:
- **Firewall logs:** A record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet and outbound requests from the network to the internet.
- **Network logs:** A record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. Records connections between devices and services on the network.
- **Server logs:** A record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

**SIEM Tools:** Used to analyze log data to monitor critical activities.

SIEM tools must be configured and customized to meet each organization's unique security needs.

 # SIEM Dashboards

**SIEM tools** can be used to create dashboards. These dashboards help security analysts quickly access their security information as charts, graphs, or tables. 

Dashboards enable analysts to identify outliers and unusual behavior more easily.

**Metrics:** Key technical attributes, such as response time, availability, and failure rate, are used to assess the performance of a software application.

# The Future of SIEM Tools

Currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for the analysis of events.

## Increasing Need for Cloud Functionality:
- **Cloud-hosted tools:** Accessed through the internet, helping organizations avoid the investment in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.
- **Cloud-native tools:** Also accessed through the internet, but designed to leverage cloud computing capabilities (availability, flexibility, scalability).

## Internet of Things (IoT):
- The development of interconnected devices with internet access.
- More devices mean a larger attack surface and more exploitable data.

## Advancements in AI and ML:
- Progress in AI and machine learning will enhance SIEM capabilities.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):
- A collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events.
