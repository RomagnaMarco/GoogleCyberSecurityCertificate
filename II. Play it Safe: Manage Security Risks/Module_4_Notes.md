# More About Playbooks

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines the expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

## When to Update a Playbook:
- A failure is identified.
- A change happens to industry standards.
- The cybersecurity landscape changes.

## Types of Playbooks:
- **Incident Response**
- **Vulnerability Response**

# Use a playbook to respond to threats, risks, or vulnerabilties

Its likely an organization has different playbooks for different types of attacks.

Example: Malware attack
- Assess the alert from SIEM tool
- Isolate/disconnect the infected system.
- Restore impacted OS and Restore Backup before the incident
- create a final report for stakeholders, report incident to authorities

  Playbooks provide a consistent process, but remember, they are a living document.
