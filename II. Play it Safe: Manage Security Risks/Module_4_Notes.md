# Phases of an Incident Response Playbook

**Playbook:** A manual providing details about any operational action.
- Establishes what tools should be used in response to a security incident.

**Incident Response:** Quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach.

## Incident Response Playbook Phases:

### Preparation
- Document procedures.
- Educate users.

### Detection and Analysis
- Detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.
- Determine the event's magnitude.

### Containment
- Prevent further damage.
- Reduce the immediate impact of the security incident.

### Eradication and Recovery
- Completely remove incident artifacts.
- Return the environment to normal operations.

### Post-Incident Activity
- Document the incident.
- Inform leadership.
- Apply lessons learned.

### Coordination
- Report incidents and share information about the incident response process according to standards.


# More About Playbooks

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines the expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

## When to Update a Playbook:
- A failure is identified.
- A change happens to industry standards.
- The cybersecurity landscape changes.

## Types of Playbooks:
- **Incident Response**
- **Vulnerability Response**

# Use a Playbook to Respond to Threats, Risks, or Vulnerabilities

Organizations are likely to have different playbooks for different types of attacks.

## Example: Malware Attack

1. **Assess the Alert from SIEM Tool**
   - Verify and validate the alert to determine if it is a true positive.

2. **Isolate/Disconnect the Infected System**
   - Immediately isolate the infected system from the network to prevent the spread of malware.

3. **Restore Impacted OS and Restore Backup**
   - Restore the operating system to a known good state.
   - Restore data from backups created before the incident.

4. **Create a Final Report for Stakeholders**
   - Document the incident, response actions, and outcomes.
   - Report the incident to relevant authorities if necessary.

## Playbooks Provide a Consistent Process

- Playbooks ensure a consistent and organized response to incidents.
- Remember, playbooks are living documents and should be updated regularly to reflect new threats, lessons learned, and changes in the cybersecurity landscape.
