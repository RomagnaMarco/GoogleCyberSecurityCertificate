I, Marco Romagna, am an aspiring professional who is actively progressing my career every day while not sacrificing my health or connections. I am diligently working to develop my SQL skills and cybersecurity fundamentals each day while managing a variety of other tasks and responsibilities.

A few of the things I value the most are the safety of myself and those around me, as well as being a positive influence on the world. One of my biggest concerns about the rise of new technologies is the sheer speed of advancement. I feel that things are moving faster than legislation can keep up with, leading to numerous shady activities.

I am committed to ensuring the integrity and safety of whatever I work on, no matter where I end up.
