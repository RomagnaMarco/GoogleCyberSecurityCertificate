# What are Networks?

**Network:** A group of connected devices.

The devices can communicate with each other through cables or wirelessly. IP and MAC addresses ensure the devices communicate with each other correctly.

## Devices Can Communicate On:
- **Local Area Network (LAN):** Spans a small area like an office building, school, or home.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country.

The internet can be considered one big WAN.

# Network Tools

## Hardware Devices

**Hub:**
- A network device broadcasting information to every device on the network.

**Switch:**
- Makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.
- More secure than a hub.

**Router:**
- A network device connecting multiple networks together.

**Modem:**
- Connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN.

## Virtualization Tools
- Pieces of software that perform network operations.
- Offered by cloud service providers.

# Network Components, Devices, and Diagrams

## Network Identifiers
- **MAC Address:** Identifies devices on a network at the hardware level.
- **IP Address:** Identifies devices on a network at the network level.

## Network Interfaces
- Each device has a network interface that sends and receives data packets.

## Network Security Devices

**Firewalls:**
- A network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network.
- Restricts data like a border patrol.
- Positioned between the secured internal network and untrusted external network resources.

## Servers and Clients

**Servers:**
- Provide information and services to devices on the network.
- A client device connects to the server, which may get data from a database it is connected to.

## Traffic Management

**Hubs and Switches:**
- **Hubs:** Direct traffic for local networks by broadcasting information to all connected ports.
- **Switches:** Send data specifically to a MAC address, making them more efficient and secure than hubs.

**Routers:**
- Operate on the network layer in the TCP/IP model.
- Forward packets to the next router on the path to the destination based on IP header information.

## Connectivity

**Internet Service Provider (ISP):**
- Connects your home/office to the internet via coaxial cables or telephone lines.

**Wireless Access Points:**
- Send and receive digital signals over radio waves, creating a wireless network.

**Wi-Fi:**
- A set of standards used by network devices to communicate wirelessly.

## Network Diagrams
- Maps showing network devices and how they connect.
- Use graphics and dotted lines to represent connections and relationships.

# Cloud Networks

A cloud model helps companies reduce costs and streamline network operations.

Cloud computing: the practice of using remote  servres, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.
Cloud Network: a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet.

Cloud services providers offer
- On-demand storage
- Processing power
- Analytics
