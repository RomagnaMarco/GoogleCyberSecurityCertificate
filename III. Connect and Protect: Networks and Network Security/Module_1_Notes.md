# What are Networks?

Network: A group of connected devices

The devices can communicate with each other through cables or wirelessly.
IP and MAC addresses ensure the devices communicate with each other correctly

Devices can communicate on:
- local Area Network (LAN): spans a small area like an office building, school, or home
- wide area network (WAN): spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country

The internet can be considered one big WAN.
