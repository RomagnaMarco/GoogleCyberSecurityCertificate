# What are Networks?

**Network:** A group of connected devices.

The devices can communicate with each other through cables or wirelessly. IP and MAC addresses ensure the devices communicate with each other correctly.

## Devices Can Communicate On:
- **Local Area Network (LAN):** Spans a small area like an office building, school, or home.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country.

The internet can be considered one big WAN.

# Network Tools

## Hardware Devices

**Hub:**
- A network device broadcasting information to every device on the network.

**Switch:**
- Makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.
- More secure than a hub.

**Router:**
- A network device connecting multiple networks together.

**Modem:**
- Connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN.

## Virtualization Tools
- Pieces of software that perform network operations.
- Offered by cloud service providers.

# Network Components, devices, and diagrams

Each device has its own MAC address and IP address which identify it on a network.
They also have a network interface that sends and recieves data packets. 

Firewalls: a network security device that monitors traffics to or from your network. They restrict data like a border patrol.
They are often between the secured and controlled internal network and the untrusted network resources outside the organization.

Servers: provide information and services to devices on the network. Devices connecting to servers are called clients.
A client could connect to the server which gets data from a database its connected to.

While both hubs and switches direct traffics for local networks, swithces sends data specifically to a MAC address, anad hubs repeat info to all connected ports.

Routers are on the network layer in the TCP/IP model. The IP address of the destination network is contained in the IP header. The router reads the IP header information and forwards the packet to the next router on the path to the destination. This continues until the packet reaches the destination network.

Internet service provider (ISP): are connecting your home/office with internet via coaxial cables or telephone lines.

Wireless access points: sends and recieves digital siignals over radio waves cvreating a wireless network.
Wifi: refers to a set of standarads used by network devices to communicate wirelessly.

Network Diagrams:L maps showing network devices and how they connect. They use graphics and dotted lines.
