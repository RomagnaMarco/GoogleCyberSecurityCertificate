# What are Networks?

**Network:** A group of connected devices.

The devices can communicate with each other through cables or wirelessly. IP and MAC addresses ensure the devices communicate with each other correctly.

## Devices Can Communicate On:
- **Local Area Network (LAN):** Spans a small area like an office building, school, or home.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country.

The internet can be considered one big WAN.
