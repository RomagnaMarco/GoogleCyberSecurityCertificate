# Security Hardening

## security hardening: the process of strengthening a system to reduce the vulnerability and attack surface.
- operated on:
  - Hardware
  - OS
  - applications
  - computer networks
  - Databases 

## Attack surface: all the possible vulnerabilities and threat actor could exploit.
## Penetration testing (Pen testing): a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processess.

Security professionals will regularly maintain security hardening procedures to keep devices secure.
- physical security includes areas with security cameras or guards
- software updates (Patches) are common
- Pen testing
- remove unused ports, applications, or services and minimized access to reduce attack surface.
