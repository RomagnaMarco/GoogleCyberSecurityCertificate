# Security Hardening

**Security Hardening**: the process of strengthening a system to reduce the vulnerability and attack surface.
- operated on:
  - Hardware
  - OS
  - applications
  - computer networks
  - Databases 

**Attack Surface**: all the possible vulnerabilities and threat actor could exploit.
**Penetration Testing** (Pen testing): a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processess.

Security professionals will regularly maintain security hardening procedures to keep devices secure.
- physical security includes areas with security cameras or guards
- software updates (Patches) are common
- Pen testing
- remove unused ports, applications, or services and minimized access to reduce attack surface.

# OS Hardening

**Operating System (OS):** Interface between hardware and the user.
- The first program loaded when a PC turns on.

**Hardening tasks:**
- Performed only once as part of preliminary safety measures.
- Performed at regular intervals:
  - **Patch Update:** A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.
  - **Hardware and software disposal**
  - **Strong password policy**
  
**Baseline configuration (baseline image):** A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

**Multifactor authentication (MFA):** A security measure that requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.
- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something unique about you
