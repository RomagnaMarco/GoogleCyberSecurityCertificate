# Security Hardening

**Security Hardening**: the process of strengthening a system to reduce the vulnerability and attack surface.
- operated on:
  - Hardware
  - OS
  - applications
  - computer networks
  - Databases 

**Attack Surface**: all the possible vulnerabilities and threat actor could exploit.
**Penetration Testing** (Pen testing): a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processess.

Security professionals will regularly maintain security hardening procedures to keep devices secure.
- physical security includes areas with security cameras or guards
- software updates (Patches) are common
- Pen testing
- remove unused ports, applications, or services and minimized access to reduce attack surface.

# OS Hardening

Operating System (OS): interface between hardware and the user
- first program loaded when a PC turns on.

Hardening tasks:
- performed only once as part of preliminary safety measures.
- performed at regular itervals
  - Patch Update: a software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product
  - Hardware and software disposal
  - strong password policy
 
Baseline configuration (baseline image): A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases and updates.

Multifactor authentication (MFA): a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.
- something you know
- something you have
- something unique about you
