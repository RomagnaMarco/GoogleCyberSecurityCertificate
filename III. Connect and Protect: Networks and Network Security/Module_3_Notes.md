# The Case for Securing Networks

## Common Network Intrusion Attacks
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage or disrupt systems.

- **Packet Sniffing:** Intercepting and capturing network packets.
- **Packet Flooding:** Overloading a network with excessive traffic to cause disruption.

## Impact of Network Attacks on Organizations

- **Costing Money and Time:** Financial losses and the need for resources to mitigate and recover from attacks.

# How Intrusions Compromise Your System

  - Can intercept network traffic and alter it.

## Backdoor Attack
- **Backdoor:** A less monitored workaround for an employee to bypass security measures. Often intentionally left to help programmers with troubleshooting or administrative tasks.
