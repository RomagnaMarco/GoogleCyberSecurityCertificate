# Introduction to Security Frameworks and Controls

## Security Frameworks
- **Definition**: Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- **Purpose**: Provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle.

### Purpose of Security Frameworks
- Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

### Components of Security Frameworks
1. **Identifying and documenting security goals**
2. **Setting guidelines to achieve security goals**
3. **Implementing strong security processes**
4. **Monitoring and communicating results**

## Security Controls
- **Definition**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

# Secure Design

CIA Triad: a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up  systems and security policies
- Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets/data
- Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, reliable
- Authority: Is accessible to those authorized to access it.

Asset: percieved to have value to an organization
  
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) : A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

# Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

Several notable ones:

### The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)
- For those working with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid.

### The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)
- Standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings.

### Center for Internet Security (CIS®)
- A nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- An international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

### The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Protects patients' health information.
- **Three Rules**: Privacy, Security, Breach Notification.
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**.

### International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- International standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders.

### System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
- A series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels.
- Used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety.

# Ethics in cybersecurity

Security Ethics: are  guidelines for making appropriate deecisions as a security professional

Ethical principles in security
- Confidentiality
- Privacy protections
- Laws

# Ethical concepts that guide cybersecurity decisions

United States standpoint on counterattacks 
- Deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal
- You can only defend
- Counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism
- Counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm
- The only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel. 

International standpoint on counterattacks
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks given:
    - The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
    - The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
    - The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
    - The counterattack effects can be reversed.
- Because it is hard to measure the above measures, most organizations don't counterattack.
- Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.

As a professional:
  - You must remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law.
  - Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.
  - Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.
  - Stay informed and strive to advance your skills, so you can contribute to the betterment of the cyber landscape
