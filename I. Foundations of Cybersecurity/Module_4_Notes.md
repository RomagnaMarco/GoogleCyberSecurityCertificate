# Common Cybersecurity Tools

## Log
- **Definition**: A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tool
- **Definition**: An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
- **Features**: 
  - Provides a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze.
  - Comes with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud.

### Commonly Used SIEM Tools
- **Splunk**: A self-hosted tool to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
- **Chronicle**: A cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis.
  - **Cloud-native**: Allows for fast delivery of new features.

## Other Key Tools
- **Playbooks**: A manual that provides details about any operational action. They guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.
- **Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)**: A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
  - **Common Packet Sniffers**: tcpdump, WireShark

Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow.

### Common Types of Playbooks
1. **Chain of Custody**: The process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
   - **Steps**:
     - A data breach happens on a computer.
     - You work with the computer and document who, what, where, and why you have collected the evidence.
     - You are responsible while it is in your possession.
     - Report it every time the evidence is moved.

2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**: The process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
   - **Steps**:
     - Consult the order of volatility (a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last, prioritizing volatile data).
     - When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used.
     - The first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data.
     - Making copies is useful to preserve the data while investigating.

# Introduction to Linux, SQL, and Python

Programming generally helps reduce human error and can help with repetitive tasks.

Linux: An open-source(publically available) operating system, not a a programming langauge.
- Relies on the Command line, but also has some GUI support.

Structured Query Language (SQL): A program language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.

Databases are organized collections of data, that can contain millions of data points. SQL is very powerful in allowing us to navigate in the database.

Python: used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.
