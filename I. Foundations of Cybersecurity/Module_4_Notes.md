# Common Cybersecurity Tools

## Log
- **Definition**: A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tool
- **Definition**: An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
- **Features**: 
  - Provides a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze.
  - Comes with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud.

### Commonly Used SIEM Tools
- **Splunk**: A self-hosted tool to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
- **Chronicle**: A cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis.
  - **Cloud-native**: Allows for fast delivery of new features.

## Other Key Tools
- **Playbooks**: A manual that provides details about any operational action. They guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks.
- **Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)**: A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
  - **Common Packet Sniffers**: tcpdump, WireShark

Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow.

### Common Types of Playbooks
1. **Chain of Custody**: The process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
   - **Steps**:
     - A data breach happens on a computer.
     - You work with the computer and document who, what, where, and why you have collected the evidence.
     - You are responsible while it is in your possession.
     - Report it every time the evidence is moved.

2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**: The process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
   - **Steps**:
     - Consult the order of volatility (a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last, prioritizing volatile data).
     - When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used.
     - The first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data.
     - Making copies is useful to preserve the data while investigating.

# Introduction to Linux, SQL, and Python

Programming generally helps reduce human error and can help with repetitive tasks.

## Linux
- **Definition**: An open-source (publicly available) operating system, not a programming language.
- **Features**:
  - Relies on the command line, but also has some GUI support.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)
- **Definition**: A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
- **Purpose**: Databases are organized collections of data that can contain millions of data points. SQL is very powerful in allowing us to navigate in the database.

## Python
- **Purpose**: Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.

# Use tools to protect business Operations

- Automation: the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks.
- Data point: a specific piece of information. These are usually in a database.
- Operating system: is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems.
- Command-line interface (CLi): is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer.
- Web vulnerability: a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.
- Antivirus software: a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware.
- Intrusion detection system (IDS): an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, where the small amount of data in the packets makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data
- Encryption: the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format.
- Cryptographic encoding: means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext.
- Plaintext: is unencrypted information
- Secure ciphertext: the result of encryption
- Penetration testing(pen testing): the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
