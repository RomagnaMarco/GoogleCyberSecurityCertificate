# Common Cybersecurity Tools

Log: a record of events that occur within an organizations systems

Security Information and Event Management(SIEM) Tool: An application that collects and analyzes the log data to monitor critical activities in an organization
- SIEM tools provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze. 
- SIEM tools also come with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud.

Two commonly used SIEM tools are: 
- Splunk: a self-hosted tool to retain, analylze and search an organization's log data
- Chronicle: a cloud native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis.

  Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.

  Other key tools:
-  Playbooks: a manual that  provides details about any operational action. They guide analysts through a series of steps to complete specific security-related tasks. 
-  Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer): a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
    - Common Packet Sniffers: tcpdump, WireShark
 
Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow.
Here are two common types of Playbooks:
- Chain of Custody:  the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle
  - Data breach happens on a computer
  - You work with the computer and document who,what,where, and why you have collected the evidence
  - You are responsible while its in your possession.
  - Report it every time the evidence is moved.
- Protecting and preserving evidence: the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence.
    - Consult the order of volatility (a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last, prioritizes volatile data)
    - When evidence is improperly managed during an investigation, it can no longer be used
    - The first priority in any investigation is to properly preserve the data
    - Making copies is useful to preserve the data while investigating.
