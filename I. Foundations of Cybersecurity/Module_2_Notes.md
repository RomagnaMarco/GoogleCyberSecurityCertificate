# Past Security Attacks

Many modern attacks are advanced or altered versions of past security attacks.

Computer virus: malicious codee written to interfere with computer operations, causing damage to data and software.
Malware: software designed to harm devices  or networks.

Brain Virus: 
1. Intention: track illegal copies of medical software to prevent pirated licences
2. An infected disk (from the pirates) was inserted into a computer
3. Any other disk inserted into the computer became infected
4. It spread globally within months, but significantly slowed down operations on large scale
   
Moris Worm:
1. Intention: Assess size of the internet
2. It installeld itself onto other computers
3. It failed to keep track of the computers it had already compromised
4. The computers kept installing it until they crashed.
  - This affected around 6,000 computers (around 10% of the internet at the time)

CERTS: computer emergency response teams were made to respond to these types of computer security incidents

# Attacks in the Digital Age

Two Notable Attacks relying on the internet:
Loveletter Malware (ILOVEYOU virus):
1.  Intentiton: steal internet login credentials
2.  Method: took advantage of those unfamiliar with unsolicted emails
3.  When opened: it scanned a user's address book, sent those people the email.
4.  For each time it was opened, it scanned for user's passwords and information.
5.  It looked like they were recieving an email from a friend.

This is the First example of Social Engineering: a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

The tradeoff of convienence over privacy brings these risks to the forefront.
Conduct regular internal trainings to keep everyone aware of these social engineering attacks.

Phishing: It tricks people into revealing sensative data or deploying malicious software via digital communications.

Equifix Breach:
- 40% of all americans affected
- SSN, Driver's Licenese Numbers, birth Dates, home addresses, Credit Card numbers.
- Multiple failures/vulnerabilities for this to have happened.

# Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness

## Phishing
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
  - Threat actor sends an email that seems to be from a known source, requesting seemingly legitimate information.
- **Spear Phishing**
  - Malicious email attack targeting specific users or groups of users, seemingly originating from a trusted source.
- **Whaling**
  - A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives in particular for sensitive data.
- **Vishing**
  - The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive info or impersonating a known source.
- **Smishing**
  - The use of text messages to trick users into obtaining sensitive info or impersonating a known source.

## Malware
- **Viruses**
  - Usually transmitted via a malicious file attachment or download. It hides itself in the now-infected system and, when opened, damages or destroys data in that system.
- **Worms**
  - Can duplicate and spread itself across systems. Can infect other devices on the same network without being opened individually.
- **Ransomware**
  - Threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware**
  - Used to gather and sell information without consent.

## Social Engineering
- **Social Media Phishing**
  - Detailed info about their target from social media sites is used to attack.
- **Watering Hole Attack**
  - A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting**
  - A threat actor leaves a malware-infected USB stick for an employee to find and install, infecting the network.
- **Physical Social Engineering**
  - A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

### Social Engineering Principles
People are trusting, and thus these types of attacks are increasing. It works well because of:

- **Authority**: Impersonation of those with power.
- **Intimidation**: Bullying tactics.
- **Consensus/Social Proof**: Pretend legitimacy.
- **Scarcity**: Imply goods or services are limited in supply.
- **Familiarity**: Fake emotional connections to exploit.
- **Trust**: Emotional relationship to exploit.
- **Urgency**: Quick response demanded without questions.

# The first things to do during a data Breach:
Remember to stay calm and methodically contain the breach. This means you need to stop the data loss as your number 1 priority. A secondary thing to do is then analyze how the breach happened.

# Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains

Depending on the organization, your role will focus either on just one domain or several domains.

## The Eight Domains:

### 1. Security and Risk Management
- Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.

### 2. Asset Security
- Secures digital and physical assets. Related to storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

### 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
- Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.

### 4. Communications and Network Security
- Manages and secures physical networks and wireless communications.

### 5. Identity and Access Management
- Keeps data secure by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical and logical assets alike.

### 6. Security Assessment and Testing
- Conducts security control testing, collects and analyzes data, and conducts security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

### 7. Security Operations
- Conducts investigations and implements preventive measures.

### 8. Software Development Security
- Uses secure coding practices (guidelines) when creating secure applications and services.
