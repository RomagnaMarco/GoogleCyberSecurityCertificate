# Past Security Attacks

Many modern attacks are advanced or altered versions of past security attacks.

Computer virus: malicious codee written to interfere with computer operations, causing damage to data and software.
Malware: software designed to harm devices  or networks.

Brain Virus: 
1. Intention: track illegal copies of medical software to prevent pirated licences
2. An infected disk (from the pirates) was inserted into a computer
3. Any other disk inserted into the computer became infected
4. It spread globally within months, but significantly slowed down operations on large scale
   
Moris Worm:
1. Intention: Assess size of the internet
2. It installeld itself onto other computers
3. It failed to keep track of the computers it had already compromised
4. The computers kept installing it until they crashed.
  - This affected around 6,000 computers (around 10% of the internet at the time)

CERTS: computer emergency response teams were made to respond to these types of computer security incidents
