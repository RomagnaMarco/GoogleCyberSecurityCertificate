# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Security Analysts serve to protect an organization from internal and external threats. When threats do get through, your team will provide a solution to remedy the situation.

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of ensuring **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

#### External Threats
- From those outside the organization trying to gain access to information, networks, or devices.

#### Internal Threats
- From current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners who accidentally leak information, abuse their permissions, or obtain unauthorized access.

An important part of security professionals' roles is maintaining Brand Trust.

### Common Job Titles
1. Security Analyst or Specialist
2. Cybersecurity Analyst or Specialist
3. Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst
4. Information Security Analyst

# Responsibilities of an Entry-Level Cybersecurity Analyst

Security professionals must be constantly improving their skills. A Security Analyst is responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

### Primary Responsibilities:
1. **Protecting computer and network systems**
    - Monitoring the internal systems until a threat is detected
    - Often look for weaknesses in the organization's own systems to prevent problems ahead of time (penetration testing/ethical hacking) to strengthen their own system and test security measures
2. **Work with IT in installing prevention software**
    - Work with development teams and ensure the organization is meeting its data protection needs
3. **Periodic Security Audits**
    - Review records and activities

Ensuring the organization and the people in it are safe is a big responsibility.

### Day-to-Day Cybersecurity Operations:
There are two sides in day-to-day cybersecurity:

- **Operations**: Responding to detections and conducting investigations. Security Analysts focus more on this.
- **Projects**: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections. Security Engineers focus more on this.

### Playbook:
A playbook is a list of procedures detailing how to handle a specific detection, outlining what the analyst needs to look at to investigate those incidents.

# Terminology

Knowing terminology is important to any cybersecurity analyst. Keeping up to date with trends and potential threats is crucial.

### Key Terms

**Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations. This helps organizations avoid fines or security breaches.

**Security Framework**: Guidelines for building plans using established good practices to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

**Security Controls**: Safeguards for reducing specific security risks. These are used with security frameworks to create a stronger security posture.

**Security Posture**: An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data to react to changes. A stronger posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

**Threat Actor**: A malicious attacker, either an individual or group, who presents a security risk relating to computers, applications, networks, or data.

**Network Security**: The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access to data, services, systems, or devices stored in the network.

**Cloud Security**: The process of ensuring assets in the cloud are properly configured and set up correctly, only allowing access to those assets for authorized users. A subfield of cybersecurity.

**The Cloud**: A network made up of a collection of servers/computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations (data centers) accessible via the internet.

### Programming Goals:
- Avoid repetitive tasks
- Review web traffic
- Alert in case of suspicious activity

# Core Skills for Cybersecurity Professionals

### Transferable vs Technical Skills

**Transferable Skills:**
- **Communication**: Explaining technical knowledge to individuals of various levels.
- **Collaboration**
- **Analysis**
- **Problem Solving**: Minimizing risks and recognizing attack problems.

**Technical Skills:**
- **Programming Languages**
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools**: Often used during periodic security audits to identify and analyze security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- **Computer Forensics**
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)**: A key tool to protect assets and data. Use these to monitor system activity and generate alerts.
- **Threat Landscape Knowledge**: Stay up to date with current trends on threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- **PII**: Any information used to infer an individual's identity.
- **Sensitive PII (SPII)**: This falls under stricter handling guidelines (e.g., SSN, medical, biometric information).
